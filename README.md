### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Im Chris Allum! 
I'm a Graduate student at Boston University studying Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I completed my undergraduate at Olin College of Engineering studying Engineering with a concentration in robotics. I'm interested in all things robotics, green tech, and entrepreneurship. I am also an avid fencer and film lover.
